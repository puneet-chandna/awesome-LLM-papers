## 📄 Paper Submission Guidelines

### ✅ We Accept Papers That:

- **Break new ground** (not incremental improvements)
- **Have practical impact** (can be applied/tested)
- **Include code or demos** (reproducible)
- **Come from credible sources** (recognized institutions/authors)
- **Are recent** (typically < 3 months old, unless foundational)

### ❌ We Don't Accept:

- Marketing disguised as research
- Papers without clear methodology
- Incremental improvements (< 5% gain)
- Closed-source with no reproducibility
- Pre-prints without peer review (unless exceptional)

## 📊 What Makes a Good Submission?

### ✅ Perfect Example:

```markdown
**Paper:** Attention is All You Need
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
**Why it matters:** Introduced transformers, replacing RNNs entirely and enabling all modern LLMs
**Key innovation:** Self-attention mechanism allowing parallelization
**Resources:** Code (✓) Demo (✓) Blog post (✓)
```

### ❌ Poor Example:

```markdown
**Paper:** Yet Another BERT Fine-tuning Paper
**Why it matters:** 0.5% improvement on GLUE benchmark
```

_Too incremental - we prioritize breakthrough research._
